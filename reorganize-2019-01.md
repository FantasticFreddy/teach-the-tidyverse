# Reorganization for rstudio::conf 2019-01

The outline below is for day 1 only.  Parenthesized times are duration/expected end.

## 00) OK, everybody, let's get started (0:15/09:15)

## 01) Two Ways to Teach (0:45/10:00)

-   Introductions
-   Comparison with movie/play (add comedy improv)
-   Tell participants there's lots of research (much of which people don't know/act on)
-   Explain schedule for both days
-   Explain what active learning is (creates a real-time feedback loop in class)
-   Introduce cognitive architecture diagram (revisit it several times)
    -   Teaching is "load into short-term memory and keep it there long enough to be transferred"
-   Bloom's Taxonomy
    -   Use revised version from early 2000s
    -   Google isn't enough if you don't know what to search for or how to recognize a useful answer when you find one
    -   GG added "awareness" to the bottom of the Bloom hierarchy since it's the most realistic goal for a workshop like this
-   Exercise: classify three learning objectives by level

## 02) Novice/Competent Practitioner/Expert (0:45/10:45)

-   Mental models
    -   Emphasize linkages: we rarely forget completely, but we lose the ability to retrieve
-   Mental models don't have to be right to be useful (ball-and-spring models in chemistry)
-   Concept maps as visual representations of mental models
-   Using concept maps:
    -   To design lesson
    -   To convey information to learners
    -   For insight into their learning
-   Exercise: draw and compare concept maps for ggplot2

## Coffee (0:15/11:00)

## 03) Teaching as Performance I (0:45/11:45)

-   Critique the Nederbragt videos
    -   https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE
    -   https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY
-   Exercise: teach in pairs (no recording)
-   Build rubric for use in afternoon

## 04) The Cognitive Craft (0:45/12:30)

-   Revisit cognitive architecture diagram and introduce 7 +/- 2
-   Lesson "scenes" should fit into working memory
    -   Use exercises/discussion/elaborative examples to keep new material there long enough to be transcribed
-   Cognitive load theory (as is)
-   Exercise: describe another pattern/chunk used in teaching

## Lunch (0:30/13:00)

## 05) Formative Assessment (0:45/13:45)

-   Importance of feedback loop while teaching (for instructor as well as learners)
-   MCQ example
-   Dual purposes of formative assessments (feedback loop + reinforcement)
-   Different kinds of formative assessment
-   Exercise: create MCQ and explain misconceptions it diagnoses

## 06) Teaching as Performance II (1:00/14:45)

-   In threes (recorded) using morning rubric
-   Lead up to the MCQ

## Coffee (0:15/15:00)

## 07) Motivation (0:45/15:45)

-   Three big motivators (self-efficacy, utility, community)
-   Three big demotivators (unpredictability, unfairness, indifference)
-   Zone of Proximal Development
-   Exercise: what demotivates people in programming classes and how do we prevent/fix it?

## 07) Multimedia Learning (0:45/16:30)

-   Material drawn primarily from 04-Make-It-Clear.pdf
-   Also show them the 6-point pitch template ("for people who...")
-   Exercise: create a visual to explain what the course is about

## 09) Wrapping Up/Looking Forward (0:30/17:00)

-   Summarize what we have learned
-   Gather open questions
-   Remind participants of Day 2's agenda(s)
